## Design Choices

### Fonts

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") has been used to find a font for the main logo for the quiz which fits the overall theme and aesthetic. The font selected for the main logo is [Bangers](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers "Bangers") as it perfectly encapsulates the theme of Japanese anime and manga with it's comic book feel. [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/ "Fontjoy") was then used to find a font to compliment [Bangers](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers "Bangers") to be used in the main body of the quiz. [BioRhyme](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/BioRhyme "BioRhyme") was selected from the [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/ "Fontjoy") results as it was found to compliment the logo font well and also matches the theme of the quiz.

### Background Image

The background image was found on [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/ "freepik") and is of a zoom effect which you would find in a manga comic panel. This image not only fits the general theme of the quiz but creates a focus on centre of the screen where the quiz will be placed.

### Colours

Two colours which were preselected are the colours found in the Japanese flag. These are the colours of red and white. A typical grey colour was also selected to imitate the style of manga, primarily being printed in black and white. [Coolors](http://coolors.co "Coolors") was then used to lock in these 3 preselected colours and create a palette to be used for the quiz. 

### Structure

The structure of the site and quiz will be one of simplicity as to not deter the user from engaging with the content. On loading, the intitial content will be of a window containing a welcome message and instructions on how to progress through the quiz. The window will also contain a button to begin the quiz and one to access the leaderboard. 

Once the start button is clicked, the welcome window will no longer be displayed and will be replaced by the quiz window. Once the quiz is complete, a result window will replace the quiz window with a form to submit the score to the leaderboard.
